## Modal dialogs for review

Dialogs added since the original sprite set was created, re-using existing sprites. We might want to design some new sprites for these cases. Please also review text content.

**(New) Change Password**
Error case is shown below, alternatively the text will read either "Your password change was confirmed" or "You cancelled the Change Password process"
